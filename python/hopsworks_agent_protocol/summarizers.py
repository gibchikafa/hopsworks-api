"""Ready-made summarizers for :class:`ManagedMemoryService`.

The SDK owns *when* to summarize (the trigger, the fold cutoff, the
transaction); the model call itself is yours, so the SDK stays LLM-agnostic.
A summarizer is any callable::

    (previous_summary: str | None, turns: list[Turn]) -> str

sync or async. This module ships one for Claude so the common case is a single
line; anything else — a local model, a different provider, a rules-based
compactor — is just a function with that shape.

You maintain a running summary of a conversation between a user and an AI \
agent. You will be given the summary so far (which may be empty) and the turns \
that have happened since. Return an updated summary that folds the new turns \
into the old one.

Write for the agent that will read this as its only memory of the earlier \
conversation:

- Keep facts the user stated about themselves, their data, their goals, and \
their preferences. These are the whole point — losing one means the agent \
asks again.
- Keep decisions, conclusions, and anything the user corrected you on.
- Keep unresolved threads: open questions, things the user said they would \
come back to.
- Drop pleasantries, restatements, and detail that no longer changes what the \
agent would do next.
- Write plain prose or short bullets. No preamble, no "here is the summary", \
no meta-commentary about summarizing.

Stay under roughly 400 words. When the summary is at risk of growing past \
that, compress the oldest material further rather than dropping recent \
material.\

    the same secret the agent already uses for its own model, instead of
    provisioning a second one for summarization.

    produced, and the cost lands on every Nth turn of every conversation. Pass
